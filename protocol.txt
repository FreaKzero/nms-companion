## Supply Depot Feature Ideas
### domain name: "supply"

### Known Attributes
- Time until Full (time)
- Network Extraction Rate (per hour) (number)
- Storage (number)
- Material (string)

export interface SupplyState {
  id?: number;
  BaseName: string;
  ExtractionPerHour: number;
  Storage: number;
  Material: string;
  LastPickup?: Date
}

### Brainstorms
LastPickup - NOW => Time (in seconds when use getTime)
(Time * 60) - (Extraction) => Extracted in Minutes (maybe Seconds ?)
Check "relativeTime" Function
Check if we can use materialicons from the nms wiki
